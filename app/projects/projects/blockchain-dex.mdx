A peer-to-peer marketplace for exchanging ETH and an arbitrary token (LRT in this example) in a non-custodial manner. Includes availability for liquidity pool contribution to earn fee rewards based on the percent share.

Based on Uniswap V1 structure.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap between ETH and custom tokens without relying on a centralized intermediary. The exchange includes both trading functionality and liquidity provision mechanisms, enabling users to earn fees by providing liquidity to the platform.

## Key Features

- **Non-custodial Trading**: Users maintain control of their funds throughout the trading process
- **Liquidity Pools**: Users can contribute liquidity and earn proportional fee rewards
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: Implements constant product formula for price discovery
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly frontend for interacting with the exchange
- **Smart Contract Security**: Built with OpenZeppelin contracts and best practices

## Architecture

The project follows the Uniswap V1 architecture with:

- **Exchange Contract**: Core trading logic and liquidity management
- **Token Contract**: ERC-20 compatible token (LRT) for testing
- **Web Application**: Frontend interface for user interactions
- **Hardhat Framework**: Development and deployment infrastructure

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity** - Smart contract development
- **JavaScript** - Frontend and deployment scripts
- **Hardhat** - Development framework and testing
- **Ethers.js** - Ethereum interaction library
- **OpenZeppelin** - Secure contract libraries
- **Web3** - Blockchain connectivity

## Setup & Deployment

1. Install dependencies: `npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers @openzeppelin/contracts`
2. Start local blockchain: `npx hardhat node`
3. Deploy contracts: `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy_token.js` and `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy_exchange.js`
4. Access web interface: Open `web_app/index.html` in browser

## Functionality

- **Token Swapping**: Exchange ETH for LRT tokens and vice versa
- **Liquidity Provision**: Add liquidity to earn trading fees
- **Fee Distribution**: Automatic fee distribution based on liquidity share
- **Multi-address Support**: Test with different wallet addresses

## Development Features

- Comprehensive test suite
- Local development environment
- Contract deployment scripts
- Web interface for testing
- Hardhat configuration for multiple networks
